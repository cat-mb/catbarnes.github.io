## The start of my coding journey.

Once I sought out computer science as a possibility, I learned there was so much you could do with lines of code. As a result? I switched majors into CS my second half of my freshman year. My interest in it was sparked when I began developing iOS apps on Swift. I would binge watch YouTube tutorials on how to connect a sequence of screens together. For about 6 months, I stayed consistent with my front-end Swift development.

## My first research project in Swift

Eventually, in my first research project over the summer, I got the opportunity to work on my personal project, "Shiba." It was meant to be a journaling app where the user could log their thoughts daily based on their own prompt or one generated for them. This allowed me to refine my skills in design, as I was introduced to Figma, a UI tool. While I was enjoying the front-end aspect, I realizied I needed to learn back-end as well. 

I attempted to understand some of the back-end features such as storing data and implementing a log-in sequence. I was hooked on this project, it was the only thing I could think about for the 6-week research period. 

## Losing fluency
Unfortunately, I had to stop for a second, as classes were starting up and over time, I lost my fluency in the Swift programming language as I was hyperfocused on my classes which required Python. I had to stop working on my project. This is when I realizied the importance of staying consistent, even if you begin to lose your own motivation to finish the things you've started. 

## Re-learning
Fortunately, I was able to join my professor's research team to help her develop a health app using iOS. This was what I needed to get back on track, and as a result, I was able to re-teach myself the Swift fundamentals and learned new skills in both front and back-end development. Once again, I am working on my personal iOS project. Now that I've got the hang of Swift again, it feels a lot better delving back into the program I once forgot how to read.
