## So, what have I learned?

From taking this course, I have honestly learned the most about databases. I had no idea postgres was a thing until we were given the assignment to link up postgres to a project. This one, I struggled with the most as it was mainly technical issues giving me trouble. However, this made me realize how asking for help is never a bad thing, as I worked closely with Chad to troubleshoot the errors.

From that experience, it confirmed the notion that most of programming really is troubleshooting errors and figuring out why your program broke down. It requires you to research beyond generative AI, it makes you look to other sources such as stack overflow, reddit, or other forms available online. A whole lot of problem solving is required to be a successful software engineer.

## But what about the course itself?

From this course, we went over many fundamentals, such as learning to program classes, experimenting with different VScode extensions, code editors online, user interface design, and how to write clean code.

I would say the skill I took the most out of was improving upon my back-end understanding of interface design skills. At first, I was heavily reliant on generative AI to get the job done for me when I would draft up a design idea in Figma. However, once we were given the many assignments on recreating Island Snow, Murphy's, and Ko Hana Rum, I began to understand the building blocks of a website, especially when it came to using tools such as Nextjs and React. 

These skills really came into fruition for me once I started on the "re-create your website of choice" assignments for Nextjs and React. As I browsed through the bootstrap components and toyed around with the style.css, I was able to apply these skills together in order to create a website to look exactly the way I envisioned. 

## So, now what?

Software engineering and computer science itself is an extremely intricate career, and you must truly enjoy what you are doing to succeed in the field. That's why I'm glad I took this course. It showed me a glimpse of what I would be getting into with pursuing a software engineering career. It reflected back to me that I was doing something I wasn't really enjoying anymore. However, I do enjoy front-end development. Other than that, I am switching my major to something else. 

While I will not be pursuing a career in tech anymore, it has left me with valuable skills. As a result of this course and previous programming classes, I am able to take on freelance web gigs. Best of luck to anyone reading this who is in the tech field. If you truly enjoy what you are doing, you will go far in your career.
