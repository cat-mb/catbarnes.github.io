## Coding with new mechanics

Honestly, this unit has been the most humbling so far. I was introduced to new mechanisms to work with, and to be honest, I'm still a little confused when it comes to what exactly ESLint does. I understood basic TypeScript fundamentals and the functional programming thinking that came along with it, but, when it came to this unit, I was thrown into a bit of chaos. Troubleshooting is one of the most useful skills when tackling coding problems. With ESLint, I believe it is able to better pick out what's going wrong with your code. At least that is what I have read it out to be on the past assignments.

## VSCode + ESLint troubles

I've had the most trouble going through these homeworks, as I couldn't figure out how to run the tests properly. I could import the respective files, but had a hard time understanding where the code fit in each file. For example, in the index.html, I couldn't really figure out how to run the preview of the functional code on Chrome. That could partly be my fault, as I resorted to asking AI to write the code out for me, so I could see what was going on. 

## My understanding ...

My personal understanding of this topic isn't too strong as of right now. I believe it's not too late to get help though. I just need to ask more clarifying questions, and with practice, I know I will get the hang of it soon.
