## Introduction

Much like how a calculator is used for complex mathematical calculations, AI can be seen to have a similar usage in the context of code. AI is a tool for coding, not something that should replace the person altogether. AI is a great tool, especially when you need complicated concepts broken down in tiny pieces in a matter of seconds instead of browsing Google or Stack Exchange for hours. I have made use of several tools such as ChatGPT, Gemini, and ClaudeAI. However, I found ChatGPT would be the most consistent when it came to thoroughly explaining code and was the most accessible.

## Personal Experience with AI

## Experience WODs e.g. E18
For the experience WODS, I found AI was useful when it came to condensing new concepts or explaining how a mechanism works when it wasn't explained in detail in the EXP WOD descriptions. 

## In-class Practice WODs
For the in-class practice WODs, AI was especially useful, especially when breaking down the code into smaller pieces, and when using the specific prompting following the steps given on the practice WODs.

## In-class WODs
For the in-class WODs, I had a similar experience using AI as with the practice WODs. The prompt of each WOD was detailed enough where I could ask ChatGPT to generate a specific section of code, all whilst reviewing the generated code to make sure it was accurate. In a way, it also made me understand the concepts better when changing specific parts of the code out.

## Essays
I don't really use AI for essay writing, other than perhaps Grammarly since that's technically an AI tool. Other than that, not useful for me.

## Final project
For the final project, AI had a similar use as to what the WODs had. I would input any errors I receieved, and would troubleshoot as directed. Most of the time, this would end up working. However, I found myself using forms at times when it came to very specific issues. Other than that, ChatGPT was great for outlining what I needed to do especially when designing the interface of the project.

## Learning a concept / tutorial
ChatGPT is phenomenal for explaining concepts and outlining tutorials. It's so easily accessible and generates responses quickly after inputting specific prompts.

## Answering a question in class or in Discord
I didn't use ChatGPT for answering a question in class or in Discord, so not much to say there.

## Asking or answering a smart-question
Same as before, I didn't use ChatGPT for asking or answering a smart-question.

## Coding example e.g. “give an example of using Underscore .pluck”
ChatGPT is great at coding examples, as it helped me to know where to edit the code when I wanted to make specific tweaks. It's good a redirecting my focus, especially if I am fixated on the wrong part of the code to fix or change.

## Explaining code
ChatGPT is great with explaining concepts and condensing them into easy terms so I could gain a better understanding of what I was looking at, and gained the ability to manually modify areas of code is needed. 

## Writing code
ChatGPT is okay with writing code, as long as you are very specific with your prompt. If you are too general though, use it with caution as it might be incorrect and throw off your entire project.

## Documenting code
ChatGPT is good with documenting the code, especially when adding specific comments to each line outlining a component or a certain function.

## Quality assurance e.g. “What’s wrong with this code <code here>” or “Fix the ESLint errors in <code here>”
Quality assurance works sometimes, but again, only if you are specific with the prompting and feed it the error and what specific line is throwing it.

## Other uses in ICS 314 not listed
I cannot think of any other uses that weren't listed. My ChatGPT usage has been covered in all aspects of this course throughout the previous thirteen points.


## Impact on Learning and Understanding
AI has in its own ways, enhanced my understanding of coding. I joined the computer science major right before generative AI began to be accessible to the public, so I understand what it's like to look on Stack Exchange or Google for hours looking for an answer. After the release of generative AI, it has sped up my understanding and efficiency of writing my code. However, there is a caveat as I feel I don't learn much when I fully generate a body of code without giving it much thought and just pasting it in. 

## Practical Applications
AI is great for managing tedious tasks. For example, when it comes to databases, it would be unfortunate if someone had to manually input each data point. However, with AI, you can ask it to generate data points for you and paste it in.

## Challenges and Opportunties
My challenge with generative AI lies with the prompting and over-reliance on it. When you don't properly prompt the AI, it can often troubleshoot your coding mistakes incorrectly, and you end up stuck in a loop of broken code. It's almost as the AI is eating its own tail; it keeps building off the already incorrect work. AI can aid opportunity through speeding up the process of learning how to code and make it quicker. Thus, making it more appealing to people who would give up the first few seconds of looking at a block of code.

## Comparative Analysis
Traditional teaching methods will just always be better than AI when it comes to the hands-on and in-person experiences at the very least. No amount of AI interaction can make up for human interaction which is a crucial skill we are beginning to lose, especially within the STEM field where its very easy to get caught up in your own work and avoid asking questions to peers.

## Future Considerations
I am a little scared for the advancement of AI. While it is nice that AI makes coding a lot smoother and quicker of a process, it's already taking jobs from other people as it's the cheapest labor possible since it is only a machine. With more layoffs, means more unemployment, which means more people are going to struggle with making ends meet and will find difficulty even landing a job interview. I believe legislation on AI will be necessary moving forward, especially with what it is capable of doing and what it will be capable of doing if it keeps advancing. 

## Conclusion
Overall, AI is great as a coding tool and has a lot of potential for its usage outside of the coding scope as well. I just think its necessary to balance the use of human knowledge and AI-knowledge, especially when out in the workforce or even working on something as simple as schoolwork.
