*As the title says ...*

My favorite part of working with UI is seeing the code in a way I can preview it. By that, I mean it's no longer theoretical-based code like if you were to run a sorting algorithim program. UI design is concrete and visually easy to get a grasp of. 

## Visually, huh? What exactly do you mean?
Even if you code something in HTML that doesn't look like English, you quickly begin to grasp it as you see it pop-up on the live server displaying your "site." Suddenly, you begin to grasp what the tags mean, especially when playing around with dividers and different sections (i.e. footer, header, navbar, etc). 

## Plenty of room for troubleshooting!
The way I grasped UI design was experimenting with how different lines of code appear on the live server. The more you play around with components, the more you begin to understand what things like "padding" or "style" or "class" mean. 

## UI design is where artistic and coding skills meet.
I don't exactly consider myself a logic-based person, which is why programming LeetCode-style problems can be difficult for me to grasp. However, when it comes to interface design, it feels like second-nature. Once again, there is something about the code showing up on the live server that cements my understanding of it. Also, I am able to use my creative skills to format websites in a manner that makes them look pleasing while maintaining functionality.

## Why do I have to strap my code with boots?
Sorry bad joke. Bootstrap 5 has served as a tool to further solidify my understanding of coding sites with HTML. Even better, without having to rely on CSS too much, as Bootstrap 5 has built-in functions that allow you to style your page. While it was a bit difficult to wrap my head around at first, I quickly got the hang of it as I kept playing around with the built in functions like making components small, medium, or large. Or even using the different numbers to manipulate the style of how a form appears.

## A newfound motivation to continue my UI Frameworks journey.
About two years ago, I had worked on a personal portfolio website entirely from scratch using HTML/CSS. However, my motivation to complete the site had went away, as I became more busy with classwork and life. This portion of our in-class unit has allowed me to regain some passion for web design, I even found myself having fun putting the assigned websites together. Perhaps, I will continue my practice on HTML/CSS from here on.
