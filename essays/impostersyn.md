## Why am I here, again?

Imposter syndrome is something almost every STEM major has experienced. Even though we have been through it before, there is some unspoken stigma around talking about it. As a result, it's difficult to find if other fellow classmates or even professors have gone through the same experience. 

## Being honest with yourself.

As a first step, it's important to reassure yourself on why you're here, and how you got here in the first place. Sometimes, it's hard to believe you got yourself to the place you are now. But there's a reason you're there in the first place! You put in all the work, and you're here now. Be nice to yourself, and understand every assignment won't be easy. Every time there is a challenge, there is an opportunity to learn! Don't see it as a block, but rather, the chance to grow your skills when it comes to approaching difficult problems. 

## You aren't alone.

While you may feel like you're the only one who is lost, most of the time, that is false. Your peers around you might feel the same way as you do. It helps to talk it through, especially with others who have gone through that self-doubt of imposter syndrome before. Confide in a trusted classmate, or even one of your professors. Guidance from an expert can help you feel less alone and have confidence you will have a successful career past college. Asking questions never hurts. In fact, it shows your willingness to hear other perspectives and keep on learning.

## Be the change you want to see. 

Initiate the difficult conversations. Make the first move to introduce yourself to other classmates. Through taking these small 'risks,' you will start to meet more people like you. Not everyone knows what's going on 100% of the time. We are bound to make mistakes. It's normal to question yourself and get lost during a lesson. Community is the most important thing that keeps us going. Start to cultivate an environment that doesn't feel as competitive and cut-throat. We are all learning together.
