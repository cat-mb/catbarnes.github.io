*To type or to script ...*

Before taking ICS 314, I actually had to learn TypeScript at my previous university in a programming language class. We had to learn 13 different languages in one semester, which sounds crazy (and it was). Despite that experience, TypeScript still feels a bit foreign to me, as I haven't practiced it as much as the "common" programming languages like Python or JavaScript. TypeScript is a decent programming language since it's not too difficult with its syntax. 

At some point after doing a couple of freeCodeAcademy problems, I began to understand the similarities and differences TypeScript shares with some other languages. In fact, there are some advantages to it as well. Function calls tend to be "safer" in TypeScript as compared to JavaScript since TS calls for types to be declared after parameters. Not only does it make the code more secure, but it also improves the readability. 

The WODs in ICS 314 remind me a lot of Leetcode questions. While some of the problems can be time-consuming and tricky to understand at first, once you work through it, it becomes easier. I like the hands-on appraoch WODs offer, as it is realistic to what a coding interview would look like. Even though the questions are challenging, that is ultimately what will help me become sharper at coding.
