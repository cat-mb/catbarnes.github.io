## **Overview**  
At UH MƒÅnoa, students rush to take notes, struggling to keep up with lectures. Alexa took great notes, but her friend Noah often missed key details. Before an exam, he searched Laulima and group chats, only to find scattered, incomplete notes.  

*"What if there was one place where UH students could share notes for every class?"*  Tokyo wondered.  

That idea became **NoteHub MƒÅnoa**, a website where students could:  
- **Upload and access notes** for any UH course.  
- **Rate notes** based on clarity and usefulness.  
- **Comment and discuss** with classmates.  

No more last-minute panic. No more missing details. Just a growing library of knowledge, built by UH students, for UH students.

## **Problem Statement**  
If you need notes for a specific class, you'd prefer notes made by peers who took that exact same course. Unfortunately, those notes are hard to find online‚Äîmany are scattered, incomplete, hidden behind paywalls, or blocked by intrusive ads.  

---

## **Solution**  
A dedicated website where students can:  
-  Upload notes categorized by **class, professor, and semester**  
-  **Search for specific notes** based on course details  
-  **Access and review notes** freely, without unnecessary barriers
