The health app, In2EAT, was created and concepted by Drs. Korpusik, Yazdansepas, and Almstedt. With the help of 5 undergraduates including myself, we were able to design, develop, and fully launch In2Eat into the app store. The process behind creating this app taught me a lot of skills ... especially with full-stack development. 

Myself, along with 2 other undergraduates, were in charge of designing the application screens and sequences from scratch. So, together, we worked on Figma to do so, giving and receiving feedback based on our designs. I was put in charge of designing the dashboard and recipe book pages. At this point, I have probably seen Xcode and Swift more often than my mom this past year. My newfound familiarity with the programming will carry me a long way, as working on Xcode has challenged me to not only develop the app's interface, but to also work on backend programming as well.

Show and tell! Here are screenshots of the sequences I created in the app. 

Starting with the Figma designs:

Then, how they look once fully coded into the app using Xcode:
